For as long as he can remember, he's had a voice in his head, but other than that he's a normal boy—right until the day when a strange-looking thing follows him home and teleports him to a place filled with more fantastic creatures. It's a space police station, and Rein Brickke, the Chief of Solar System Department, tells him that he's been chosen by the computer as a possible candidate to join the police force. Misuzu Sonokata, a girl from Chuuta's school with an angelic face and ill temper who turns out to be one of Rein Brickke's subordinates, doesn't think him suitable for such a job. Chuuta, who was shocked at first, decides to take the aptitude test after being urged by the voice in his head and to prove Misuzu wrong.""]"	nan	['Kokonose, Chuuta', 'Sonokata, Misuzu', 'Blick, Laine', 'Drew', 'Taklamakan Strange, Love', 'Boroswick, Veronica', 'Mizoguchi, Ken', 'Mihailovna Pavlova, Nina', 'Kokonose, Mimi', 'Victor, Vega']	['Murase, Ayumu', 'Hayami, Saori', 'Suzuki, Tatsuhisa', 'Kugimiya, Rie', 'Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu', 'Iida, Riho', 'Kondou, Takashi', 'Lynn', 'Kimura, Akiko', 'Kamiya, Hiroshi']	[['Furuta, Jouji', 'Director'], ['Takadera, Takeshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Tanaka, Tomoya', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Assistant Director'], ['Alfakyun.', 'Theme Song Performance']]
