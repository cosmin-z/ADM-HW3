Alongside Mutsuko Sakura, his classmate from elementary school, he aims to lead the team to glory. However, due to unexpected circumstances, Fuurin's baseball team is left with only six members: Daigo, Mutsuko, Yayoi Sawa, Tao Sagara, Seira Kandori, and Hiromu Tanba. Left with mostly female players and lacking in experience, the team struggles to gain confidence and trust from the new recruitsâ€”Akira Nishina, Anita Kabashima, and Chisato Fujii. Facing challenges such as having no proper coach, problematic recruits, and a limited number of members, Daigo's resolution is put to the test as he tries to bring the team together in time to participate in their first ever tournament."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]', '\n', '\n']"	['Alternative version: Kunimatsu-sama no Otoridai']	['Shigeno, Daigo', 'Sakura, Mutsuko', 'Nishina, Akira', 'Honda, Gorou', 'Satou, Toshiya', 'Shimizu, Kaoru', 'Fujii, Chisato', 'Sawa, Yayoi', 'Satou, Hikaru', 'Sagara, Tao']	['Fujiwara, Natsumi', 'Hanazawa, Kana', 'Yamashita, Daiki', 'Uesaka, Sumire', 'Kawase, Maki', 'Sakura, Ayane']	[['Watanabe, Ayumu', 'Director'], ['Kameyama, Toshiki', 'Sound Director'], ['Yamai, Sayaka', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Konuta, Kenji', 'Script']]
