These enemies originate from Vega’s sister star Altair and raid Vega for human life. As a countermeasure, an organization known as Neo-DEAVA formed to combat the Abductors. They pilot advanced mecha suits called Aquaria and are strictly separated by gender. Boys and girls are not allowed contact; they are even restrained from fighting on the same battlefield. However, events take a shocking turn when an advanced Abductor mecha suit joins the fray. Two teenagers, Mikono and Amata, are dragged into the conflict. Unknowingly, Amata performs a taboo when he summons an Aquaria and initializes what is called the Forbidden Union between male and female Aquaria. Neo-DEAVA is shocked, and the repercussions of Amata’s actions are much farther reaching than he realizes. How was he able to summon an Aquaria? Where did he learn to form a Forbidden Union? And why was Mikono also able to pilot the mecha suit?']	['Adaptation: Aquarion Evol', 'Prequel: Sousei no Aquarion', 'Other: Sousei no Aquarion Evol', 'Sequel: Aquarion Logos']	['Suzushiro, Mikono', 'Wong, Zessica', 'Demuri, Kagura', 'Sora, Amata', 'Apollo', 'Muso, Jin', 'de Alisia, Silvia', 'Hole, Andy W.', 'Fudou, Zen', 'Elan, Shrade']	['Kayano, Ai', 'Hanazawa, Kana', 'Uchiyama, Kouki', 'Kaji, Yuki', 'Terashima, Takuma', 'Fukushima, Jun', 'Kakazu, Yumi', 'Toriumi, Kousuke', 'Fujiwara, Keiji', 'Namikawa, Daisuke']	[['Kawamori, Shouji', 'Director, Storyboard, Mechanical Design, Original Creator'], ['Yamamoto, Yuusuke', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director'], ['Tachikawa, Yuzuru', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
