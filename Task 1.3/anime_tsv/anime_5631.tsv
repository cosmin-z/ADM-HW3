In this tournament, 100 Heavenly Beings known as the ""God Candidates"" are required to search among the middle school students on Earth, and transfer their powers to a student of their choice. The chosen ones will then battle each other, representing their God Candidates. The victor of this tournament will be awarded the ""Blank Talent""—allowing them to choose any one unique ability they so desire—while the God Candidate they represent will obtain the position of ""God"" and become the king of the Heavenly World.
