It has taken everything they have just to avoid relegation. To make matters even worse, the team has lost five matches in a row, leading to abysmal team morale. Even the fans are beginning to abandon them, and rumors hint that the home ground municipality is going to withdraw their support. With countless coaches fired and poor financial choices in hiring players, it is a downward spiral for ETU."", '\n', '\n', '\n', ""\r\nThe board of directors, under pressure from general manager Kousei Gotou, takes a gamble and hires a new coachâ€”the slightly eccentric Takeshi Tatsumi.
