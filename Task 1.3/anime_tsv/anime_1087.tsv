However, there is the possibility of the consciousness failing to return to the host\'s body, rendering them stuck inside their new metallic frame for good. Such is the situation of members of the Excavate Company, a reckless band of I-Machine miners led by the notorious Grayman that aims to gather orichalt for profit.  ', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nDuring a mining incursion, the group rescues Maya Mikuri, a student who was abandoned by her crew.
