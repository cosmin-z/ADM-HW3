When she opens the door to Music Room #3 hoping to find a quiet place to study, Haruhi unexpectedly stumbles upon the Host Club. Led by the princely Tamaki Suou, the club—whose other members include the ""Shadow King"" Kyouya Ootori; the mischievous Hitachiin twins, Kaoru and Hikaru; the childlike Mitsukuni Haninozuka, also known as ""Honey""; and his strong protector Takashi ""Mori"" Morinozuka—is where handsome boys with too much time on their hands entertain the girls in the academy.', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""\r\nIn a frantic attempt to remove herself from the hosts, Haruhi ends up breaking a vase worth eight million yen and is forced into becoming the eccentric group's general errand boy to repay her enormous debt. However, thanks to her convincingly masculine appearance, her naturally genial disposition toward girls, and fascinating commoner status, she is soon promoted to full-time male host. And before long, Haruhi is plunged into a glitzy whirlwind of elaborate cosplays, rich food, and exciting shenanigans that only the immensely wealthy Host Club can pull off."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]']"	['Adaptation: Ouran Koukou Host Club']	['Suou, Tamaki', 'Fujioka, Haruhi', 'Hitachiin, Hikaru', 'Ootori, Kyouya', 'Hitachiin, Kaoru', 'Haninozuka, Mitsukuni', 'Morinozuka, Takashi', 'Nekozawa, Umehito', 'Kasanoda, Ritsu', 'Houshakuji, Renge']	['Miyano, Mamoru', 'Sakamoto, Maaya', 'Suzumura, Kenichi', 'Matsukaze, Masaya', 'Fujita, Yoshinori', 'Saitou, Ayaka', 'Kirii, Daisuke', 'Ueda, Yuuji', 'Hatano, Wataru', 'Yoshizumi, Kozue']	[['Cook, Justin', 'Producer'], ['Minami, Masahiko', 'Producer'], ['Tamura, Manabu', 'Producer'], ['Igarashi, Takuya', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard']]
