What's Michael? 2	OVA	1	2000-01-01 00:00:00	-	511	6.05	185	8432	12920	"['Michael the orange tiger cat returns for another series of vignettes.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nThe sketches this time include a three-part send-up of The Fugitive, the famous 1960\'s TV show. Richard Kimble is now a veterinarian on the lam (lamb?), running from a false conviction for a murder committed by ""a man with overbite."" Despite the omnipresent danger, he must stoop and intervene whenever he sees a cat (always Michael) suffering; after treating the patient, he plays a trick on the cat and runs away. (He\'s a fugitive, after all.) Another sketch draws parallels between wandering husbands and wandering house cats, who seem to have similar proclivities. Two more point out what happens when a cat\'s instincts run up against the requirements of baseball or pro wrestling.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: Orphan Fansubs)']"	['Prequel: Osomatsu-san Short Film Series', 'Other: Osomatsu-san: Haru no Zenkoku Dai Senbatsu Jouei-sai - Sentou Quiz 2', 'Parent story: Osomatsu-san 2nd Season']	['Michael', 'Kimble, Dr. Richard', 'Police Lt.
