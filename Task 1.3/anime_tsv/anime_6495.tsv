Yuki no Taiyou Pilot	Special	1	1972-01-01 00:00:00	-	2682	5.37	1380	10747	8694	"[""This pilot is remembered, really, for one notable reason: this is Miyazaki's first time as a solo director. He teamed up with Takahata for the later episodes of the 1971-72 Lupin III series, but Yuki's Sun marked his first time solely in the captain's seat."", '\n', '\n', '\n', ""\r\nYuki's Sun was based upon a popular shoujo manga (girls' comic) by Tetsuya Chiba which was serialized in 1963. It involves a 10-year-old orphan girl who is adopted into a family. The storyline is somewhat complex, and seems to play out like grand melodrama. Chiba's stories were more sophisticated and grown-up than, say, Osamu Tezuka, who of course was the godfather of postwar Japanese manga."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: TheGhibliBlog)']"	nan	[]	[]	nan
