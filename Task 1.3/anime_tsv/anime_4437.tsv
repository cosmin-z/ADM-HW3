Maybe the original purpose of this story is to unravel the mysteries bound in this time and world. For the humans who found this vast rare multi-level city, the mysterious main character ""Kirii"" wanders to search for the ""Net Terminal Genes"" that were not infected. Kirii\'s burden and his search for the ""Net Terminal Genes"" is a goal like no other and is very much the mystery of this story. Log1~Log6 contains the story of Cibo that wasn\'t done in the original works. The Cibo who strayed away with Kirii and wanders about. A disc thrown away in the rubble. Cibo starts downloading. Just who\'s ""Memory"" will he end up with?', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: AniDB)', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nNote: These clips are meant as a bonus to the manga, and should only be taken as such.
