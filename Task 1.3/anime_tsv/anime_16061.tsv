D-Frag!*	OVA	1	2014-09-22 00:00:00	-	57800	7.34	32266	2208	2309	"[""After Sakura Mizukami shows up at the Kazama household to ask for a favor, Kenji Kazama and his sister Noe end up unwillingly participating in a footrace at the local shrine. Intent on winning the prize—spring water that only appears once per year—Sakura recruited the Kazama siblings to guarantee her victory. But when Sakura's clubmates, Chitose Karasuyama and Roka Shibasaki, enter the race as well, the girls' competitive energy is unleashed and the contest immediately develops into an all out battle where no victor is certain. What's more, Noe, fed up with Sakura's constant teasing, has no interest in helping her win, and the battle rages not only on the field, but between the divided team members."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]']"	['Adaptation: D-Frag!', 'Parent story: D-Frag!']	['Kazama, Kenji', 'Mizukami, Sakura', 'Kazama, Noe', 'Shibasaki, Roka', 'Takao', 'Karasuyama, Chitose', 'Conecone, Shawn', 'Shinsen', 'Takao, Mother']	['Konishi, Katsuyuki', 'Takahashi, Mikako', 'Katou, Emiri', 'Hanazawa, Kana', 'Itou, Shizuka', 'Saitou, Chiwa', 'Nakata, Jouji', 'Yuzuki, Ryouka']	[['Haruno, Tomoya', 'Original Creator']]
