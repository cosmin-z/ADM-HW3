Based on a 1992 novel by Yoshio Aramaki, the series focuses on a technologically advanced Imperial Japanese Navy and a radically different Pacific War that was brought about by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's revival in the past due to unexplained circumstances. The series also features real-life 1940s figures whose first names were changed, such as Winston Churchill to Kingston Churchill and Adolf Hitler to Heinrich von Hitler."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n(Source: Wikipedia)']"	['Adaptation: Hajimete no Gal', 'Prequel: Hajimete no Gal']	['Maebara, Issei', 'Takasugi, Eisaku', 'Takano, Isoroku', 'Otaka, Yasaburou', 'Roosevelt, Henry']	['Tanaka, Hideyuki', 'Ginga, Banjou', 'Yara, Yuusaku', 'Fujimoto, Yuzuru', 'Tokumaru, Kan']	[['Kanda, Takeyuki', 'Director'], ['Matano, Hiromichi', 'Director'], ['Matsuura, Noriyoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Takahashi, Ryousuke', 'Script, Series Composition, Screenplay']]
