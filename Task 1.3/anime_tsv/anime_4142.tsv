He is assisted by 3 nubile female assistants who also use the teaching cover and who, in typical Satoru Akahori, favor tight/skimpy/bondage outfits over their ample curves as they constantly pursue Sorata much more than he pursues them, although the girls do get some attention from their master. Not only is Mouse pursued by the girls & the local law enforcement authorities, there is also a secret art protection society employing the services of a former ally of Sorata's after his pretty little hide, all in 15 minute episodes.""]"	['Adaptation: Mouse']	['Muon, Sorata', 'Momozono, Mei', 'Kuribayashi, Yayoi', 'Kakio, Hazuki', 'Onizuka, Heitaro', 'Momozono, Fuyuharu', 'Morishima, Samarsa', 'Nyan, Rin', 'Fon', 'Yukino, Uta']	['Yamaguchi, Kappei', 'Inoue, Kikuko', 'Fukui, Yukari', 'Nakahara, Mai', 'Nagasako, Takashi', 'Ikeda, Masaru', 'Momoi, Haruko', 'Akai, Tomato', 'Asai, Harumi', 'Sanada, Asami']	[['Satomi, Tetsurou', 'Producer'], ['Takayama, Katsuhiko', 'Script'], ['Kawasaki, Hiroyuki', 'Script'], ['UNDER17', 'Theme Song Performance']]
