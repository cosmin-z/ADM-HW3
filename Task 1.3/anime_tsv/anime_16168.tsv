The three dream of raising the money needed to build their own concert hall, where their band—Nerima Daikon Brothers—would perform and hopefully rise to stardom. But their farm and Ichiro's host club job aren't raising money fast enough for their liking, leading them to resort to get-rich-quick schemes."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nTheir plans usually involve tracking down evil-doers and then stealing their ill-gotten gains.
