Some of the less popular characters introduced in chapters III and IV, particularly Buju, were nowhere to be seen. Nevertheless, such strategies did little to get this final saga off the ground and the story was shelved.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)']	['Prequel: Mujintou Monogatari X']	['Amanojaku', 'Amano, Megumi', 'Kuroko', 'Itou, Akemi']	['Nishimura, Tomohiro', 'Takada, Yumi', 'Yamaguchi, Yuriko']	[['Aikawa, Shou', 'Script'], ['Maeda, Toshio', 'Original Creator']]
