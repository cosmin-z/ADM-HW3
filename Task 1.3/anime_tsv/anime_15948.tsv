In a bid to raise their social status, their servant, a robotic cat named Doraemon, decides to travel back in time and guide Nobita on the proper path to fortune. Unfortunately Doraemon, a dysfunctional robot that the familly acquired by accident (but chose to keep nonetheless), isn't much better off than Nobita. The robot leads Nobita on many adventures, and while Nobita's life certainly is more exciting with the robot cat from the future, it is questionable if it is in fact better in the way that Doraemon planned."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: AniDB)', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', <b>Note: The series has been poorly preserved, and never released on any format, nor has it ever been re-aired.
