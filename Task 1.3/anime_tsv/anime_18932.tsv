During the war, Germania set its sights on the weak alpine country of Elystadt. Boasting a far superior military and having achieved profuse success earlier in the war, it was expected that Germania would conquer Elystadt with ease.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nMatters are only made worse for the small country when Germanian soldiers capture their princess, Ortfiné ""Finé"" Fredericka von Eylstadt, as she is heading to a crucial meeting with Britannia.
