Rebelling against this, Mabel wants to be a great detective, and sets out for London to become assistant to none other than Hercule Poirot, the great Belgian detective who resides there. She finally wins the reluctant approval of her father, and embarks on an exciting life of mystery and suspenseâ€”his only demand being that she occasionally spend some time with her great-aunt, Jane Marple, in the small village of St. Mary Mead.']	['Adaptation: Agatha Christie no Meitantei Poirot to Marple']	['Poirot, Hercule', 'Marple, Jane', 'West, Mabel', 'Hastings, Arthur', 'Rice, Frederica', 'Miss Lemon', 'Sharpe, Inspector', 'Dunn, Eliza', 'Reed, Gwenda', 'Erskine, Richard']	['Satomi, Koutarou', 'Yachigusa, Kaoru', 'Orikasa, Fumiko', 'Nojima, Hirofumi', 'Tanaka, Atsuko', 'Yara, Yuusaku', 'Morimoto, Leo']	[['Ozeki, Masayuki', 'Episode Director'], ['Shimura, Jouji', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Ooseki, Masayuki', 'Episode Director'], ['Yonemura, Shouji', 'Script']]
