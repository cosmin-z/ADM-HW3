Good at both academics and sports on top of being elegant and sociable, she has been an object of admiration all her life. However, in reality, she is an incredibly vain person who toils relentlessly to maintain her good grades, athleticism, and graceful appearance. She wants nothing more than to be the center of attention and praiseâ€”which is why she cannot stand Soichiro Arima, the male representative for her class and the only person more perfect than her.
