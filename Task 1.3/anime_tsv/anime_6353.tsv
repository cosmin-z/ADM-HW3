Located in the heart of the Tower Country, the immensely tall tower stretches high into the sky, reaching seemingly infinite heights. The tower looks like something out of a dream, but the breathtaking construction is unmistakably real. Intrigued, the traveling partners Kino and Hermes—the talking motorcycle—journey to the tower to get a closer look at the building.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nDespite already being unbelievably tall, the tower is still being built by the townspeople to this day. Puzzled by the origins of the tower, Kino and Hermes ask around the town for information, but they fail to obtain any definitive answer. They continue to observe both the tower and the townspeople during their stay, hoping to understand the reasoning behind building a tower that requires so much effort. After all, there is always something to learn... even from the strangest of countries.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]']	['Full story: Mobile Suit Gundam 00']	['Kino', 'Hermes']	['Maeda, Ai', 'Aigase, Ryuji']	[['Sigsawa, Keiichi', 'Original Creator'], ['Kuroboshi, Kouhaku', 'Original Character Design']]
