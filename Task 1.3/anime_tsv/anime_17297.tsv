The phenomenon is so big that an entire city was built for the racing industry where competitions take place on a huge track. In the “Immortal Grand Prix,” two teams of three IG machines, high-tech humanoid mechs driven by humans, race at speeds greater than 400km/h. The teams make three laps of a 60 km course while intercepting the opponent as they vie for a first place finish. The best machine performance, the best pilots and the best teamwork are the only factors that can make them the winners.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: Production I.G.)']	['Alternative version: IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix', 'Sequel: IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix (2005) 2nd Season']	['Ricarro, Liz', 'Jinno, Takeshi', 'Stapleton, Amy', 'Rublev, Andrei', 'Ishikawa, Masa', 'Himawari, Aoi', 'Satomi, Michiru', 'Luca', 'Cunningham, Alex', 'Ballasteros, Judy']	['Watanabe, Akeno', 'Mito, Kouzou', 'Ono, Ryouko', 'Tanaka, Masahiko', 'Horikawa, Jin', 'Sudou, Yumi', 'Shinohara, Emi', 'Yamazaki, Vanilla', 'Miki, Shinichiro', 'Mitsuishi, Kotono']	[['Terashima-Furuta, Maki', 'Producer'], ['Hongou, Mitsuru', 'Director'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director'], ['Nishimura, Hiroyuki', 'Episode Director, Script, Storyboard']]
