Episode 1 is a brief introduction to the weaponry carried by the Ingram and how it was designed and why it is the way it is. Episode 2 looks at the design and maintenance of the Ingram 98 AV in SVU2 and takes a swipe at the marketing forces behind them (as in merchandising for the series). Episode 3 is the only one to attempt to expand on a very minor point raised in the original TV show and just how SVU2 is actually funded.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: ANN)']"	['Prequel: Red Garden']	['Gotou, Kiichi', 'Nagumo, Shinobu', 'Shiba, Shigeo', 'Izumi, Noa', 'Clancy, Kanuka', 'Shinohara, Asuma', 'Oota, Isao', 'Yamazaki, Hiromi', 'Sakaki, Seitarou', 'Shinshi, Mikiyasu']	['Oobayashi, Ryuusuke', 'Sakakibara, Yoshiko', 'Chiba, Shigeru']	[['Kamiyama, Kenji', 'Director, Animation Director'], ['Oshii, Mamoru', 'Script'], ['Hyoudou, Mako', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Kawai, Kenji', 'Music']]
