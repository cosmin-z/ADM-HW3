When a pack of dogs race through a Zol-controlled mine, Van, an enslaved former soldier, and a young girl named Yuna are both bitten, but manage to escape as the sole survivors of the attack. Finally free, Van and Yuna seek out a simple, peaceful existence in the countryside. But as the deadly disease once again runs rampant, they find themselves at the crossroads of a struggle much larger than any one nation."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\r\n(Source: GKIDS)']"	['Adaptation: Shiratori Reiko de Gozaimasu!']	['Makoukan', 'Sae', 'Hossal', 'Yuna', 'Van', 'Pyuika', 'Sforsam, Tohrim', 'Yotal', 'Akafah King', 'Rimuell']	['Watanabe, Anne', 'Takeuchi, Ryouma', 'Kimura, Hisui', 'Tsutsumi, Shinichi']	[['Matsushita, Keiko', 'Producer'], ['Andou, Masashi', 'Director, Chief Animation Director, Character Design, Animation Director'], ['Miyaji, Masayuki', 'Director'], ['Kikuta, Hiromi', 'Sound Director']]
