Mikado Ryuugamine is now one step closer to his goal of living an exciting life, and in turn, delves deeper into the darker side of Ikebukuro. After gaining absolute control over a former rival, he uses his newfound power as he pleases, purging the Dollars from the inside to mold it into the ideal organization. This proves to be as challenging as it sounds as Mikado must now deal with unwanted outside interference, most notably a re-emerging and dearly missed friend. Meanwhile, Izaya Orihara still has some schemes up his sleeve, although a rival information exchange center has proven to be quite the hindrance, lurking within everyoneâ€™s favorite downtown district. Undoubtedly, sooner or later, chaos will strike again.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]']	['Adaptation: Nurarihyon no Mago', 'Prequel: Nurarihyon no Mago', 'Summary: Nurarihyon no Mago: Sennen Makyou Recaps', 'Other: Nurarihyon no Mago OVA']	['Orihara, Izaya', 'Heiwajima, Shizuo', 'Sturluson, Celty', 'Kishitani, Shinra', 'Ryuugamine, Mikado', 'Sonohara, Anri', 'Kida, Masaomi', 'Brezhnev, Semyon', 'Kadota, Kyouhei', 'Karisawa, Erika']	['Kamiya, Hiroshi', 'Ono, Daisuke', 'Sawashiro, Miyuki', 'Fukuyama, Jun', 'Toyonaga, Toshiyuki', 'Hanazawa, Kana', 'Miyano, Mamoru', 'Kuroda, Takaya', 'Nakamura, Yuuichi', 'Takagaki, Ayahi']	[['Oomori, Takahiro', 'Director, Sound Director'], ['Kouno, Ayako', 'Episode Director'], ['Kondou, Natsuko', 'Episode Director, Animation Director'], ['Takagi, Noboru', 'Script, Series Composition']]
