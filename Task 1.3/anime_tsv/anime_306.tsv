However, Shungo's life ceases to be normal the moment a cute girl named Mayu Tsukimura descends into the middle of his school's campus in a military-grade helicopter. It turns out Ryoko sent this girl, along with her older brother Mikihiro, to live at the Ninomiya household."", '\n', '\n', '\n', ""\r\nBut the newly-arrived siblings are a little special: Mayu is, in fact, a succubus and her brother, an incubus! And as if the circumstances are not problematic enough, Mayu is crippled with androphobia—the fear of men—and it's up to Shungo to help her overcome this at the behest of his sister. Ryoko plans to force Mayu to be closer to Shungo, and to do this, she’ll employ some questionable methods such as having them share the same bed and even take baths together. "", '\n', '\n', '\n', ""\r\nThe situation further complicates when student council president Reika Houjou arrives as the new maid of the Ninomiya family, and she will stop at nothing to thwart Shungo and Mayu’s sexually-geared training. With the sudden arrival of all these oddities, Shungo's ordinary life is about to be thrown into utter turmoil."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]']"	['Other: Gakuen Handsome The Animation', 'Sequel: Gakuen Handsome Special']	['Tsukimura, Mayu', 'Houjou, Reika', 'Ninomiya, Shungo', 'Ninomiya, Ryouko', 'Kirishima, Shinobu', 'Ayakawa, Hinako', 'Tsukimura, Mikihiro', 'Hosaka, Mitsuru', 'Yoshida, Heisuke', 'Okushiro, Irori']	['Kadowaki, Mai', 'Sawashiro, Miyuki', 'Majima, Junji', 'Neya, Michiko', 'Chiba, Saeko', 'Akesaka, Satomi', 'Narita, Ken', 'Miyata, Kouki', 'Kondou, Takashi', 'Tsunakake, Hiromi']	[['Yoshikawa, Kouji', 'Director'], ['Iwanami, Yoshikazu', 'Sound Director'], ['Shiraishi, Michita', 'Episode Director'], ['Abe, Masashi', 'Episode Director']]
