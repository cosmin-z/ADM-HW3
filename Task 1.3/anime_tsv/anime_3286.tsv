TO-Y	OVA	1	2006-10-27 00:00:00	-	2681	6.15	1031	7915	8685	"['Two weeks before a concert at Yaon Hibiya auditorium (1987.8.26), while playing at the club Shinjuku Loft, lead vocalist To-Y (pron: to-o-i) of the band GASP is jumped by a rival, Aikawa Yoji. GASP is a upcoming band known for its violence, struggling to be noticed against the popularity of hotshot Aikawa, who\'s #1 on the charts and beloved by his fans. The Yaon Hibiya concert represents GASP\'s mainstream debut to break out of the small-time club scene, which is threatened by the schemes of Aikawa\'s manager, Ms. Kato of Koyama Productions. Kato wants To-Y to leave that ""bunch of hoodlums,"" and sing independently for a major label. ', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\nAdding to the confusion is an unexplained character who manifests feline traits, named Niya. Niya presents herself as ""To-Y\'s aijin"" (""Niya, To-Y no aijin da yo!"") to the consternation of Koishikawa Hiderou, who has interest in To-Y. Koishikawa, also known as ""Sonoko-chan,"" is typed as a ""okama"" by Niya. A running motif is GASP, it\'s fans, and associates regarded as unusual by the mainstream public, as exemplified by their musical taste, dress, and Classic Coke-drinking, which only contributes to more difficulty in their struggle to be accepted.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n(Source: AniDB)']"	['Parent story: Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!']	['Yamada, Niya', 'Fujii, To-Y', 'Isami', 'Momo', 'Kaie', 'Shouji', 'Koishikawa, Hidero', 'Kato, Kashiko', 'Aikawa, Yoji']	['Nokko', 'Shiozawa, Kaneto', 'Yamada, Tatsuo', 'Genda, Tesshou', 'Sogabe, Kazuyuki', 'Seki, Toshihiko', 'Yayoi, Mitsuki', 'Hitotsuyanagi, Miru', 'Uchida, Naoya']	[['Hamatsu, Mamoru', 'Director'], ['Hashimoto, Izou', 'Script'], ['Psy S', 'Theme Song Performance, Inserted Song Performance'], ['Onda, Naoyuki', 'Animation Director']]
