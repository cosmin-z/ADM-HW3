The rules are simple: one player has to carry the ball past the goalposts across the field while avoiding the other team, who are allowed to use all their force to knock the enemy down. However, the player can pass to a teammate behind them or kick the ball before they are tackled. Unlike other sports, the game continues even when the person holding the ball is taken down.', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""\r\nKenji Gion is a short but feisty high school freshman at Kanagawa High School.
