Captain Tsubasa: Sekai Daikessen!! Jr. World Cup	Movie	1	1986-07-12 00:00:00	-	4469	6.81	2116	4586	7334	"['In the fourth movie, the classical Japan-Europe match becomes intercontinental. This time they arrange a world cup with 4 teams: Japan, USA, ""All Europe"", and ""All South America"". In the first match, Japan easily defeats the USA 3:0 and in the second match Europe loses 2:3 against South America. In the final round S.A. shows their ""soccer cyborg"" Carlos Santana, a more than supreme player who seems to be undefeatable. All their classical tricks like Hyugas ""Tiger Shot"" or Tsubasas ""Top Spin"" seem to be totally worthless, but in a hard and spectacular match the Japanese learn more and more to play in unison and finally they get the win.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n(Source: ANN)']"	['Parent story: Captain Tsubasa']	['Oozora, Tsubasa', 'Wakabayashi, Genzou', 'Misaki, Tarou', 'Santana, Carlos', 'Nakazawa, Sanae', 'Schneider, Karl-Heinz']	[]	[['Takahashi, Yoichi', 'Original Creator'], ['Udagawa, Kazuhiko', 'Key Animation'], ['Okayasu, Hajime', 'Editing'], ['Nagao, Hitoshi', 'Art Director']]
