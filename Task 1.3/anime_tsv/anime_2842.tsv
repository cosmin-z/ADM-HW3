Through the use of so-called ""cognition particles"" left behind at a crime scene by the perpetrator, detectives from the specialized police squad Kura can manifest a criminal\'s unconscious mind as a bizarre stream of thoughts in a virtual world. Their task is to explore this psychological plane, called an ""id well,"" to reveal the identity of the culprit.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nNot just anyone can enter the id wells; the prerequisite is that you must have killed someone yourself.
