But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob\'s only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks.', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""\r\nIn order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Arataka Reigen, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change.
