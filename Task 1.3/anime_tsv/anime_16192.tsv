On one hand you have Kai, born as the son of a prostitute, who's been playing the abandoned piano in the forest near his home ever since he was young. And on the other you have Syuhei, practically breast-fed by the piano as the son of a family of prestigious pianists. Yet it is their common bond with the piano that eventually intertwines their paths in life."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: KEFI)']"	['Adaptation: Piano no Mori', 'Alternative version: Piano no Mori', 'Sequel: Piano no Mori (TV) 2nd Season']	['Ichinose, Kai', 'Amamiya, Shuuhei', 'Ajino, Sousuke', 'Ichinose, Reiko', 'Maruyama, Takako', 'Pang, Wei', 'Szymanowski, Lech', 'Adamski, Karol', 'Amamiya, Namie', 'Shiba, Takatarou']	['Saitou, Souma', 'Hanae, Natsuki', 'Suwabe, Junichi', 'Sakamoto, Maaya', 'Yuuki, Aoi', 'Nakamura, Yuuichi', 'KENN', 'Konishi, Katsuyuki', 'Miyake, Marie', 'Yanaka, Hiroshi']	[['Nakatani, Gaku', 'Director'], ['Nagasaki, Yukio', 'Sound Director'], ['Saeki, Shouji', 'Storyboard'], ['Yuuki, Aoi', 'Theme Song Performance']]
