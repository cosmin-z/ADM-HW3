However, many Promin who have turned into bugs known as ""Bugmin"" are responsible for many of the world\'s real-life bugs. Left alone, they may eventually turn into a big problem. The boy Yuuto encounters the space dog Wanda, and the pair use a camera-like device and key items to capture Bugmin. Promin themselves are able to do things like ""accelerate objects,"" ""spew fire,"" or ""create objects,"" through an ability known as ""Kamiwaza"" (miracle), and are able to fend off Bugmin with it. At first, the Bugmin only cause small, bothersome things, but it will soon elevate into a global scale threat. Can one boy and one dog save the world?', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: ANN)']"	nan	['Kamiya, Yuuto', 'Wanda', 'Terara', 'Megaga', 'Gigaga', 'Nicole', 'Sakamoto, Souma', 'Mirai', 'Tateishi, Shuuichi', 'Kamiya, Yui']	['Kokuryu, Sachi', 'Yamaguchi, Kappei', 'Katou, Emiri', 'Hamazoe, Shinya', 'Ogami, Shinnosuke', 'Miruno, Jun', 'Iwase, Shuuhei', 'Mimori, Suzuko', 'Shindou, Kei', 'Kuno, Misaki']	[['Hashimoto, Mitsuo', 'Director'], ['Matsuoka, Hiroki', 'Sound Director'], ['Hatori, Jun', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Assistant Director'], ['Yamaguchi, Kappei', 'Theme Song Performance, Inserted Song Performance']]
