In the wild world, the human race is just a very weak race, facing a severe risk of survival, and it is the blood of another race. The four guardians of mankind are old and have not been able to find a suitable successor. The last four decided to integrate their flesh and blood into the wild and earth, and chose a new successor according to the world’s wishes.
