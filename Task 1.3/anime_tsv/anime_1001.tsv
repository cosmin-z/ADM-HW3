Harumi Kazuhito is a high school boy who loves books and is a fan of novelist Natsuno Kirihime. One day, he finds Kirihime writing at a cafe, about to be shot by a robber. He protects her from the attack but is killed instead. Through the supernatural power of a book-worm, he is reincarnated as a dachshund dog. Kazuhito (as a dog) writhes in a painful bookless life, when a sadistic woman carrying a pair of scissors offers him help. She is Kirihime herself.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: Dog and Scissors Wiki)']	['Adaptation: Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou']	['Natsuno, Kirihime', 'Harumi, Kazuhito', 'Hiiragi, Suzuna', 'Akizuki, Maxi', 'Oosawa, Hami', 'Moribe, Sachi', 'Honda, Sakura', 'Hotokezaka, Daimon', 'Himehagi, Momiji', 'Inukai, Kiyoshi']	['Inoue, Marina', 'Sakurai, Takahiro', 'Itou, Shizuka', 'Serizawa, Yuu', 'Kakuma, Ai', 'Saitou, Chiwa', 'Uchida, Maaya', 'Koyama, Rikiya', 'Kayano, Ai', 'Hatano, Wataru']	[['Takahashi, Yukio', 'Director'], ['Watanabe, Jun', 'Sound Director'], ['Abe, Masashi', 'Episode Director'], ['Ishiyama, Takaaki', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
