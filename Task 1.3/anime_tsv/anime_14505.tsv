His investigation reveals the names of three high school girlsâ€”Ayano Yukawa, a gravure model; Misuzu Inami, a public entertainment actress; and Rina Tsubaki, his sister's close friend. His heart filled with vengeance, Ryou kidnaps the three girls and brings them into an abandoned building in the middle of a remote forest. He then proceeds to violate the girls individually in front of a live streaming camera, hoping to make them confess their sins to the world while uncovering the truth behind the destruction of his family."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]']"	None	['Tezuka, Ryou', 'Tsubaki, Rina', 'Yukawa, Ayano', 'Inami, Misuzu', 'Tezuka, Kaoru']	['Hayase, Yayoi', 'Itou, Hasumi', 'Hirayama, Yukari']	[['Yokoyama, Hiromi', 'Director'], ['Hakudaku, Ouji', 'Episode Director'], ['Waffle', 'Original Creator']]
