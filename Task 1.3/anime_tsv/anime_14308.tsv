He didn’t have any interest in inheriting the shrine. Instead, he focused on his studies, aiming to be a civil servant upon graduation. His widowed father talked about marrying a young girl, but then he suddenly disappeared. That girl Erina came to live with him, along with her younger sister Motoka. With the help of his childhood friend Mio and a few supporters of the shrine, they managed to continue living normal lives. One day, Erina brought home a girl Mai, who called herself his fiancée. One thing led to another, culminating with Erina ordering him to get her pregnant.']	None	['Nonohara, Mio', 'Kudou, Mai', 'Hirose, Motoka', 'Okazaki, Erina']	['Akino, Hana', 'Takada, Hatsumi', 'Nishino, Korone']	[['Honjou, Masato', 'Original Character Design']]
