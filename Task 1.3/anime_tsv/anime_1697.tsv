Orpherus, Eduard, Camus, Lui, and Naoji are five noblemen who attend the prestigious Rozenstolz academy, and who are a part of the Strahl class—a class for potential candidates for the advisory positions in the royal palace in the small European country of Kuchen. Isaac is an English writer who visits Kuchen. While still students, the five noblemen are forced to deal with corrupted politicians, secret agents, attempted murder and ambitious individuals from both inside and outside of school who threatens to break the fragile peace in their country, and even assassinate the king.']	['Adaptation: Meine Liebe: Eien Naru Traumerei', 'Sequel: Ginyuu Mokushiroku Meine Liebe Wieder']	['Herzog von Mohn Nahe Liechtenstein, Ludwig', 'Pfalzgraf von Silvaner Lüneburg, Camus', 'Ishizuki, Naoji', 'Fürst von Marmelade Nahe Görz, Orpherus', 'Markgraf von Sekt Braunschweig, Eduard', 'Cavendish, Sir Isaac', 'Torger, Josef']	['Seki, Toshihiko', 'Hoshi, Souichirou', 'Ishida, Akira', 'Sakurai, Takahiro', 'Seki, Tomokazu', 'Koyasu, Takehito', 'Canna, Nobutoshi']	[['Mashimo, Kouichi', 'Director'], ['Morioka, Hiroshi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Kawasaki, Hiroyuki', 'Script'], ['Omode, Akemi', 'Script']]
