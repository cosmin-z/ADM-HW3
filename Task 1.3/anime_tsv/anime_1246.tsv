Based on a compatibility calculation, young people at the age of 16 are assigned marriage partners by the government, with severe repercussions awaiting those who disobey the arrangement. For Yukari Nejima, a teen that considers himself average in every way, this system might be his best shot at living a fulfilling life.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nHowever, spurred by his infatuation for his classmate and long-time crush, Misaki Takasaki, Yukari defies the system and confesses his love. After some initial reluctance, Misaki reciprocates his feelings in a moment of passion. Unfortunately, before the two can further their relationship, Yukari receives his marriage notice. He is then thrown into a confusing web of love and lies when his less-than-thrilled assigned partner, Ririna Sanada, becomes fascinated with his illicit romance.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]']"	['Adaptation: Koi to Uso', 'Other: Koi to Uso OVA']	['Takasaki, Misaki', 'Sanada, Ririna', 'Nisaka, Yuusuke', 'Nejima, Yukari', 'Igarashi, Shuu', 'Yajima, Motoi', 'Ichijou, Kagetsu', 'Nisaka, Kidou', 'Mimasaki, Arisa', 'Takeda, Daiki']	['Hanazawa, Kana', 'Makino, Yui', 'Tachibana, Shinnosuke', 'Oosaka, Ryouta', 'Kitamura, Eri', 'Taniyama, Kishou', 'Kurosawa, Tomoyo', 'Ishida, Akira', 'Shimamura, Yuu', 'Adachi, Yuuto']	[['Satomi, Tetsurou', 'Producer'], ['Shiba, Hirokazu', 'Producer'], ['Takuno, Seiki', 'Director'], ['Tsuruoka, Youta', 'Sound Director']]
