Catman Series II	ONA	8	2014-04-07 00:00:00	-	1170	6.21	592	7650	10750	"[""In a city filled with anthropomorphic cat-people, Catman lives free of rules and boundaries, doing everything he wants, which often collides with the other inhabitants of the city. Created entirely in flash, with no spoken dialog, Catman instead speaks in English and Japanese subtitles. The series is spread across three so-called 'seasons', with only the third having been aired.""]"	['Adaptation: Juuou Mujin no Fafnir']	['Catman']	[]	[['The Planet Smashers', 'Inserted Song Performance']]
