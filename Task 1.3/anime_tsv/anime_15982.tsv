To put an end to this seemingly endless conflict, Demon King Anos Voldigoad willingly sacrificed his life, hoping to be reborn in a peaceful future.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nIn preparation for their king\'s return, the demon race created the Demon King Academy, an elite institution tasked with determining Anos\' identity when he reawakens. He reincarnates two millennia later, but to his surprise, he soon learns that the level of magic in the world has drastically waned during his absence. Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently. His personality, his deeds, and even his legacy are all falsified—masked beneath the name of an impostor. This ""lack"" of common knowledge renders him the academy\'s outlier—a misfit never before seen in history.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nDespite these drawbacks, Anos remains unfazed.
