Yes, the ever troublesome pollen allergy season has come to defile its victims once more, but it's not their noses that are being blown."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nThrough the miracles of evolution, the reproductive process of plants no longer yield the tiny yellow grains that stimulate the nose. Instead, they now produce beautiful girls and boys that float joyfully through the air, stimulating other areas of the body instead, whether willing or not.
