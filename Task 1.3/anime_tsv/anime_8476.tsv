But on performance day, the princess gets sick, and I have to take her place! I'm dreading the final kissing scene. We're just supposed to pretend, but now... our lips are... touching...! I know it's Izuru... but he looks like a handsome prince, and... he's actually kinda hot......"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: Ebook Renta)']"	nan	nan	nan	nan
