Meitetsu) as part of their ""Place important feelings on places where important people wait."" campaign. ', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\r\nIn the short we see a woman and her fianc√© on a Nagoya Railroad train to go meet her parents. The woman laments over her youth from having fun as a child with her father on the train, to coldly ignoring him and being mean as a teenager when he comes to pick her up from the station with a spare umbrella on a rainy day. Time healed all wounds and the short ends with the both of them smiling cheerfully as they treasure each other.']"	None	nan	nan	nan
