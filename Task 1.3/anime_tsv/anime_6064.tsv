It is during his icy slumber that terrifying creatures known as ""Beasts"" emerge on the Earth\'s surface and threaten humanity\'s existence. Willem awakens 500 years later, only to find himself the sole survivor of his race as mankind is wiped out.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nTogether with the other surviving races, Willem takes refuge on the floating islands in the sky, living in fear of the Beasts below. He lives a life of loneliness and only does odd jobs to get by. One day, he is tasked with being a weapon storehouse caretaker. Thinking nothing of it, Willem accepts, but he soon realizes that these weapons are actually a group of young Leprechauns. Though they bear every resemblance to humans, they have no regard for their own lives, identifying themselves as mere weapons of war. Among them is Chtholly Nota Seniorious, who is more than willing to sacrifice herself if it means defeating the Beasts and ensuring peace.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nWillem becomes something of a father figure for the young Leprechauns, watching over them fondly and supporting them in any way he can. He, who once fought so bravely on the frontlines, can now only hope that the ones being sent to battle return safely from the monsters that destroyed his kind.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite] ']"	['Adaptation: Uchuu Kaizoku Captain Herlock', 'Side story: Space Pirate Captain Herlock: Outside Legend - The Endless Odyssey', 'Character: Ginga Tetsudou 999 (Movie)', 'Spin-off: Queen Emeraldas', 'Sequel: Herlock Saga: Nibelung no Yubiwa', 'Alternative setting: Gun Frontier', 'Alternative version: Waga Seishun no Arcadia']	['Nota Seniorious, Chtholly', 'Kmetsch, Willem', 'Ruq Insania, Nephren', 'Myse Valgulious, Ithea', 'Ytri Historia, Rhantolk', 'Hrqstn, Elq', 'Nygglatho', 'Asplay, Lillia', 'Rin Purgatrio, Collon', 'Nox Katena, Pannibal']	['Tadokoro, Azusa', 'Arai, Ryouhei', 'Uehara, Akari', 'Machico', 'Aranami, Kazusa', 'Okada, Hikari', 'Inoue, Kikuko', 'Satou, Rina', 'Kino, Hina', 'Kubo, Yurika']	[['Wada, Junichi', 'Director'], ['Motoyama, Satoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Anzai, Takefumi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Marchi, Jamie', 'Script']]
