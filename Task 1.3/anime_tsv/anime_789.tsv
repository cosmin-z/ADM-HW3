Calamity befalls the human race when malevolent creatures known as ""daemons"" scourge the land and obliterate armies with seemingly unstoppable brute force. In these dire times, nobles of House Caelum rise to prominence.

The ambitious and charismatic pragmatist, Somnus Lucis Caelum, is pit against his humble and altruistic brother, Ardyn Lucis Caelum, in competition for the throne. As tensions rise between the rivals and anticipations surge, the fate of the world rests upon one of the two's decisive victory."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]']"	['Parent story: Tottoko Hamtarou', 'Sequel: Tottoko Hamtarou OVA 2: Hamuchanzu no Takara Sagashi Daisaku - Hamuha!
