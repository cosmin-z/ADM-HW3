Silvia feels that Joe is taking her for-granted and wants to do something together for once, so Joe decides to take her to see an old action movie featuring his favorite hero, Captain Blue. What started out as a cute movie date takes a turn for the worst when Silvia is pulled into the movie by the leader of the evil organization, Jado.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nJoe follows her into the mysterious ""Movieland,"" and is granted a powerful device known as a V-Watch by Captain Blue himself.
