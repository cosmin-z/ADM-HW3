That is, until he meets the mysterious Shirogane, a man who suddenly appears and tells him that they have a destiny together. When Akira hears this, he is shocked and doesn\'t believe a word of it. Aya, a friend of Akira, forgets something in the school one night, and asks Akira to help her and go find it. He agrees, and while there, he gets attacked by a shadow monster. Shirogane convinces him that the balance between the human world and the shadow world has been distorted and that Akira must become a ""shin""- a creature of the shadow world- in order to help restore the balance. The anime has shonen-ai themes which are completely absent from the manga.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)']"	['Adaptation: Monochrome Factor']	['Shirogane', 'Nikaidou, Akira', 'Asamura, Kengo', 'Kujou, Haruka', 'Suzuno, Aya', 'Kou', 'Nanaya', 'Homurabi', 'Wagatsuma, Shuuichi', 'Asamura, Mayu']	['Suwabe, Junichi', 'Ono, Daisuke', 'Kamiya, Hiroshi', 'Saiga, Mitsuki', 'Asano, Masumi', 'Konishi, Katsuyuki', 'Yoshino, Hiroyuki', 'Okiayu, Ryoutarou', 'Hatano, Wataru', 'Koshimizu, Ami']	[['Kou, Yuu', 'Director'], ['Tsuruoka, Youta', 'Sound Director'], ['Yamada, Yuka', 'Script'], ['Tamura, Koutarou', 'Storyboard']]
