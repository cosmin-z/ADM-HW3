On planet Eden, a top-secret project known as ""Supernova"" is being held to determine U.N. Spacy\'s next-generation variable fighter. Competing to win the funding are Shinsei Industries\' YF-19 and General Galaxy\'s YF-21. Piloting the YF-21 is Guld Goa Bowman, a half-human, half-Zentraedi. Shinsei receives its new test pilot in the form of the unruly fighter pilot Isamu Dyson, who was once a friend of Guld. Meanwhile, as Isamu and Guld furiously battle to see which of their fighters is superior, a Virturoid Idol named Sharon Apple is to perform her debut concert on Eden. In charge of Sharon is producer Myung Fang Lone, another former friend of Isamu and Guld. When the three meet each other, old disputes spark from a troubled past. Little do they know that their past incidents—along with the Supernova Project and Sharon Apple—will somehow bring them together.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: ANN)']"	['Full story: One Piece']	['Dyson, Isamu Alva', 'Bowman, Guld Goa', 'Fang Long, Myung', 'Apple, Sharon', 'McMillan, Lucy', 'Masseau, Kate', 'Gueldoa, Marj', 'Marley, Reymond', 'Masseau, Morgan', 'Johnson, Millard']	['Yamazaki, Takumi', 'Ishizuka, Unshou', 'Fukami, Rica', 'Hyoudou, Mako', 'Hayashibara, Megumi', 'Takano, Urara', 'Hayami, Show', 'Ginga, Banjou', 'Yara, Yuusaku', 'Utsumi, Kenji']	[['Kawamori, Shouji', 'Director, Storyboard, Mechanical Design, Creator'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director'], ['Watanabe, Shinichiro', 'Storyboard, Assistant Director'], ['Higuchi, Shinji', 'Storyboard']]
