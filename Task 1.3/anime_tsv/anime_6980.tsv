Futon	Movie	1	2012-01-01 00:00:00	-	776	5.17	420	11182	11806	['A futon, a traditional Japanese mattress, as seen by Yoriko Mizushiri, becomes the vehicle of dream fantasies combining the most pleasant sensations such as the morning coffee, the warmth of bedding and a soft rice carpet under oneâ€™s feet. Lazy stretching serves as a start of sensuous, sleepy gymnastics. With a fluid movement, the passive body will turn once again from the left to the right of the mattress to dive into the fantasies of even deeper unconsciousness a little while later.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\r\n(Source: Krakow Film Festival)']	nan	[]	[]	nan
