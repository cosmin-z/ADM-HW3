The film depicts a macabre game played by two rabbits and a blindfolded woman. The rabbits face each other over an old-fashioned illustrated board game. When they land on a square, the woman must eat the food indicated in the illustration. If she has chosen correctly, a die pops out of her mouth and lands on the floor giving the rabbits their next move."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\r\n(Source: Midnight Eye)']"	['Adaptation: Nora no Hakobune', 'Sequel: Twinkle Nora Rock Me!']	nan	nan	nan
