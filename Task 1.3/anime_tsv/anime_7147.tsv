Inspired by optical illusions, like Escher\'s paintings, I made the film using isometric drawings. my idea was to make a great film using only transformations of rectangular parallelepipeds. I applied the method of geometric animation, a technique used in Metropolis, in this film. Along with ""cell"" animation, I continue making films with the application of this method.
