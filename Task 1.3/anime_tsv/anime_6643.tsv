Miho loves to design clothing, but her aunt and three cousins don\'t believe that such a young girl is capable and mock her designs. Meanwhile, a contest for the new ""Disco Queen"" is coming up, and Miho wants nothing more than to be able to design a dress for someone to wear to the competition, since she\'s too young to enter herself. With determination and a little bit of magic, Miho\'s dreams just might come true!']"	['Adaptation: Joker Series']	['Miho', 'Shuri', 'Mayor', 'Aunt']	['Yamamoto, Yuriko', 'Hara, Eriko', 'Shibata, Hidekatsu', 'Takashima, Gara']	[['Takahashi, Motosuke', 'Director'], ['Matsuura, Noriyoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Terada, Kenji', 'Script'], ['Kishi, Yoshiyuki', 'Character Design']]
