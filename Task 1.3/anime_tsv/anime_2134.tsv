Chironup no Kitsune	Movie	1	1987-08-15 00:00:00	-	914	6.37	235	6833	11370	"[""Foxes Ken and Chin become the proud parents of cubs, Koro and Kan, who enjoy a carefree life on the northern Japanese island of Chironup. They befriend a fisherman and his wife but are forced to run for their lives when soldiers on a military exercise decide to take home some fox pelts as souvenirs. A sweet little film that obliquely symbolizes the plight of Japan's aboriginal Ainu people and the northern islands that have been contested with Russia since they were occupied by Stalin's soldiers in 1945."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)']"	['Parent story: Doraemon (1979)']	[]	[]	nan
