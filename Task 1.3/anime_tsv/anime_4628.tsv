Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\nThroughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)']	['Spin-off: Koisuru Tenshi Angelique: Kokoro no Mezameru Toki', 'Prequel: Angelique', 'Sequel: Angelique: Seichi yori Ai wo Komete']	['Mokku', 'Carlo', 'Ojii-san', 'Koorogi', 'Yousei']	['Maruyama, Hiroko', 'Nakagi, Ryuuji', 'Yada, Minoru', 'Kimotsuki, Kaneta', 'Ikeda, Masako']	[['Yoshida, Kenji', 'Producer'], ['Kramer, Steve', 'Script'], ['Columbia Yurikago Kai', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Kogawa, Tomonori', 'Key Animation']]
