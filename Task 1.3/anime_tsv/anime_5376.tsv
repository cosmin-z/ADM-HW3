Bara no Hana to Joe	Movie	1	1977-03-01 00:00:00	-	880	5.69	409	9777	11463	"[""It's a Sanrio picture that feels partly like an anime art film and partly like a Warner Bros. cartoon. The film features some very creative imagery, a groovy 70's jazz score, and very little spoken dialogue. It's a story about a dog named Joe that falls in love with a rose and protects it from a mean spirited crow. There's some energetic Fritz Freeling style action. There's also some unexpectedly grim tragedy, not including the anticipated outcome, which does occur as expected."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n(Source: animenation.net)']"	['Adaptation: Fushigi no Kuni no Miyuki-chan']	['Crow', 'Rose', 'Joe']	[]	[['Yanase, Takashi', 'Director, Theme Song Lyrics, Art Director, Series Composition, Original Creator'], ['Seri, Youko', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Ishikawa, Yamako', 'Background Art']]
