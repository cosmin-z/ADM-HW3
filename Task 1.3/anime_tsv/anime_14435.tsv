With the aid of Kiriko, his court enchantress, and Sand, the servant of the King of Demons, the dastardly prince enacts a coup to gain control of the castle and become the next king. He succeeds, but not before being reminded of his agreement with Sand: to extract the holy energy within Lilia as a tribute to the King of Demons. Dirk then proceeds to corrupt his mother and Lilia with all sorts of perversions, hoping to fulfill his task on time while turning the two into his loyal slaves.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]', '\n', '\n']	['Adaptation: Hitozumaâ™ªKasumi-san: Oyako to Kyoudou Seikatsu']	['Evelvine, Lilia', 'Kiriko', 'Evelvine, Lelia', 'Evelvine, Dirk', 'King Luffen', 'Sand']	['Inokuchi, Yuka', 'Sakamoto, Jun', 'Yunagi, Miu', 'Shibata, Hidekatsu']	[['Yoshida, Tomohiro', 'Sound Director'], ['Lilith Soft', 'Original Creator'], ['Okazaki, Hideo', 'Director of Photography']]
