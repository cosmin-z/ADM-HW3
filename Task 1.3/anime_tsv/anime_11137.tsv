When he locates one of these spirits, he cannot simply kill it; he must first learn its Form, its Truth, and its Reason in order to wield the mighty Exorcism Sword and fight against it. He must begin  his strange exorcisms with intense psychological analysis and careful investigative workâ€”an extremely dangerous step, as he must first confront and learn about the mononoke before he even has the means to defeat it.', '\n', '\n', '\n', ""\r\nThe Medicine Seller's journey leads him to an old-fashioned inn where Shino, a pregnant woman, has finally found a place to rest.
