By removing the organs of a possessed animal and transplanting them into humans, fairies can be summoned as an alter ego and be used as a weapon. Such individuals who used fairies as war tools were called ""Fairy Soldiers."" Once the war was over and they completed their roles, the soldiers lost their purpose.
